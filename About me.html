    <h3> About me: </h3>
        <p> Hello, I’m Roei Osher Shabat, a dedicated individual with a diverse set of skills and experiences across various fields. I have a strong background in coding and computer science, which I studied during my education at אורט במעלה טבריה, where I developed a deep understanding of technology and problem-solving. My passion for coding is complemented by my experience in photo editing, a skill I've honed through both personal interest and professional work.</p>

        <p> In addition to my technical expertise, I have experience in sales, having worked as a salesman for four months, where I developed key communication and negotiation skills. Furthermore, I spent a year and a half working as a waiter at a prestigious restaurant, where I learned the importance of discipline, attention to detail, and providing top-tier customer service.</p>

        <p>I strive for balance in my life, and aside from work, I maintain an active lifestyle by regularly going to the gym. I take all aspects of life seriously, whether it's perfecting my coding abilities, staying physically fit, or sharpening my skills in customer service and sales. </p>
